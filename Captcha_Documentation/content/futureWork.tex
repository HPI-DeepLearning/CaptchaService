With the thought in mind of building an easy expandable service, the logic consequence would be on focussing on different Captcha types. In the process, key factors such as access for disabled users can be tackled, e.g. by implementing audio Captchas.
Another aspect would be expanding the Webinterface. The option of downloading solved and unsolved Captchas can be specialized by selectin specfic upload times or certain time spans. A feedback of the labeling progress within a task would also be another great tool.
