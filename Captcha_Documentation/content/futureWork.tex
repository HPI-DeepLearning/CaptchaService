With the thought in mind of building an easy expandable service, the logic consequence would be on focusing on different Captcha types. In the process, key factors such as access for disabled users can be tackled, e.g. by implementing audio Captchas. The accessibility for all users is important to allow for an unrestricted usage of the Webservices.
Another aspect would be expanding the web interface. The option of downloading solved and unsolved Captchas can be specialized by selecting specific upload times or certain time spans. A feedback of the labeling progress within a task would also be another great tool.
