There are several Captcha types, each one being suitable for labeling different data.

Google's reCapcha is the major player for text Captchas. While google was analyzing  and making digital copies of books, their CRM algorithms were not able to identify every word. Google used reCaptcha to identify these words. The user was asked to identify two words, of which one word was known and used for validation.
