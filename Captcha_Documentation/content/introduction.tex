\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
Researchers and scientists are lacking the time and capacities to label their data, which is often further needed in order to advance other technologies. Using required authentication processes for online users, we are able to utilize huge amounts of free labor. Our main goal was building a straightforward service for researchers and scientists to allow precise data labeling.

Therefore, a simple integration for web services was also wanted.
