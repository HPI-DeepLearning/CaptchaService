\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Machine and deep learning are great tools for tackling more and more complex tasks and problems. However, therefore a great number of data is required in order to train classifiers. Researchers and scientists are lacking the time and capacities to label data on their own, which is often further needed to advance and improve other technologies.

Using required authentication processes for online users, we are able to utilize huge amounts of free labor. Our main goal was building a straightforward service for researchers and scientists to allow precise data labeling. A Captcha service is an ideal solution for data labeling, while at the same time providing additional benefit by providing security from bot attacks.
We had to find a trade-off between a convenient, secure solution and a way to label data reliably.
A main criteria was also the expandability of the system, allowing to easily integrate further Captcha types for various data.

In order to allow a user friendly usage of the service, a web interface was required for uploading and downloading data.

Last but not least, a simple integration for web services was needed to allow for a fast and widespread usage of the Captcha service.
