With the thought in mind of building an easy expandable service, the logic consequence would be on focusing on different Captcha types. Another important Captcha type would be the labeling within one image. Therefore, an uploaded image could be split up into nine smaller images and like in our already implemented image Captcha, the user has to select the images with a specific object in it. In the process, key factors such as access for disabled users can be tackled, e.g. by implementing audio Captchas. The accessibility for all users is important to allow for an unrestricted usage of the web services using the Captcha service.

Another aspect would be expanding the web interface. The option of downloading solved and unsolved Captchas should be further able to specialize, e.g. by selecting specific upload times or certain time spans. Since newly uploaded data might extend existing tasks, a researcher might only want to extract his uploaded Captchas.
The option for uploading images could need some improvements concerning it's usability, since their are strict requirements for the structure and naming of the uploaded .zip-files. More flexibility in choice about how to upload the data and error feedback would simplify the usage of the captcha service.


Integrating feedback of the labeling progress within a task or uploaded data, is another feature necessary to improve the Captcha service.
